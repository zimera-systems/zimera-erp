Sale Secondary Unit Module
##########################

The sale secondary unit module adds a secondary unit of measure on sale lines.
The secondary quantity and unit price are kept synchronized with the quantity
and unit price.
The secondary unit is defined on the product with its factor against the sale
unit.

If the sale product customer module is activated, a specific secondary unit may
be defined on the product customer. And it overrides the definition on the
product.
